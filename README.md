# Sales Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Power BI to analyze sales data and create an interactive dashboard.  
The dataset was pre-cleaned, and the focus of the project was on building meaningful visualizations and extracting business insights.

Tools Used
- Power BI (dashboard creation, visualization)
- Excel (basic exploration)

Dashboard Features
- Total sales and revenue trends over time
- Regional performance comparison
- Product category breakdown
- Product sub-category breakdown
- Interactive filters/slicers for dynamic analysis

Key Insights
- Regional Sales Concentration: Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh together account for nearly 43% of total sales, showing strong geographic dependence.
- Payment Mode Trends: Cash on Delivery (COD) dominates with 43.7% of transactions, suggesting reliance on traditional payment methods despite UPI growth.
- Profit Volatility: Profits fluctuate significantly across months — with losses in May–July and December, indicating possible seasonal challenges or discount-heavy periods.
- Customer Contribution: Top 5 customers contribute a noticeable share (e.g., Harivansh and Madhav together ~19K), highlighting the importance of repeat buyers.
- Category Insights: Clothing drives 62% of sales volume, but electronics and furniture, though smaller, contribute higher margins in sub-categories like printers and bookcases.
- Sub-Category Profitability: Printers (~8K profit) and bookcases (~6K) outperform clothing items like sarees (~4K), showing that high-margin products are not always the highest in sales volume.

Business Impact 
- Strategic Focus on Regions: Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh together drive over 40% of revenue, suggesting that marketing and logistics investments should prioritize these states.
- Payment Optimization: With COD making up nearly 44% of transactions, businesses could reduce costs and risks by encouraging digital payments (UPI, cards) through discounts or loyalty programs.
- Seasonal Profit Management: Losses in May–July and December highlight the need for seasonal pricing strategies, inventory control, or promotional campaigns to stabilize profitability.
- Customer Retention: Top customers contribute significantly to revenue, showing that loyalty programs or personalized offers could increase repeat purchases.
- Product Strategy: Clothing dominates sales volume, but electronics and furniture deliver higher margins. Businesses can balance volume vs. margin by promoting profitable sub-categories like printers and bookcases.

Future Improvements
- Connect to raw datasets and perform cleaning before visualization.
